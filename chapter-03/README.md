# Lesson 3 - Variables

## Declarations

We have already declared many variables with a syntax that looks like:

```go
var x int = 0
```

However, there are other ways to declare a variable. The following lines are
all equivalent, and any one of them would be compiled into the same machine
code instructions:

```go
var x int = 0
var x = 0
x := 0
var x int
```
