I referenced [Make games using Odin and Raylib #3: An animated player
](https://zylinski.se/posts/gamedev-for-beginners-using-odin-and-raylib-3/) to learn how to do an animation from a sprite sheet.

https://www.raylib.com/examples/textures/loader.html?name=textures_image_drawing shows how to draw multiple images on one texture.
