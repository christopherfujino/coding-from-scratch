## Final Project

Write a program that prompts the user for two numbers which will be typed into
the terminal, and then print back to the terminal for the user the sum of
their two numbers.

The output of the program (including the user's input) should look like:

```
Hello, I am an advanced artificial intelligence. To prove it, I will tell you
the sum of any two numbers you give me.

What is your first number? 1
What is your second number? 2

The sum of 1 and 2 is 3.
```
